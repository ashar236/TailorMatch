    "prompt": "the following error classes for a product matching classification system, please classify the following product pair into all error classes by their number if they are relevant for this pair. Please give a short explanation of every decision as a list first. Finally also provide a confidence score for each classification adhering to the JSON format of the following example: ```{\"2\":\"90\",\"4\":\"30\",\"5\":\"75\"}```\n\nFalse Negatives:\n1. Model Number Mismatch: The system fails due to slight differences in model numbers or product codes, even when other attributes match closely.\n2. Attribute Missing or Incomplete: The system fails to recognize a match when one product listing includes an attribute that the other does not.\n3. Minor Differences in Descriptions: Small differences in product descriptions or titles can lead to false negatives, such as slightly different wording or the inclusion/exclusion of certain features.\n4. Price Differences: Significant price differences can lead to false negatives, as the system might weigh price too heavily even when products are similar.\n5. Variant or Accessory Differences: Differences in product variants or accessories included can cause false negatives, especially if the system does not adequately account for these variations being minor.\n\nFalse Positives:\n\n6. Overemphasis on Matching Attributes: The system might give too much weight to matching attributes like brand or model number, leading to false positives even when other important attributes differ.\n7. Ignoring Minor but Significant Differences: The system fails to recognize important differences in product types, models, or features that are significant to the product identity.\n8. Misinterpretation of Accessory or Variant Information: Including or excluding accessories or variants in the product description can lead to false positives if the system does not correctly interpret these differences.\n9. Price Discrepancy Overlooked: The system might overlook significant price differences, assuming products are the same when they are not, particularly if other attributes match closely.\n10. Condition or Quality Differences: Differences in the condition or quality of products (e.g., original vs. compatible, new vs. refurbished) are not adequately accounted for, leading to false positives.\nEntity 1: {{entity_1}}\nEntity 2: {{entity_2}}\nSystem answer: {{system_answer}}\nCorrect label: {{correct_label}}"
